Prerrequisites for building:

+ libasio
+ catch
+ libssl-dev
+ cmake
+ restbed (https://github.com/Corvusoft/restbed) - assume it is compiled and its 'distribution' directory copied into /opt/restbed
+ rapidjson (https://github.com/Tencent/rapidjson) - assume it is downloaded and its 'include/rapidjson' directory copied into /opt/rapidjson/include

This setup is fragile and not very standard - studying some way to make it all work on vcpkg or conan
